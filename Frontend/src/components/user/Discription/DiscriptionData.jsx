                In a single script, users can choose a measurement type (percentage or points) to set their booking and re-entry points. If users opt for the percentage measurement, users establish these points based on a percentage of the asset's price. With the point measurement, they use fixed points.

                <p> Fixed price:</p>
                In the fixed price feature, users can set the specific price at which they want to buy or sell an asset. Additionally, they have the option to set an entry range around that fixed price. If the market price falls within that range, the software will automatically execute the trade.
